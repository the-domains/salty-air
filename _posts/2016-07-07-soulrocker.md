  Just recently I was able to experience one of my most favorite concerts
  {Michael Franti & Spearhead} at Summerfest. Picture a small crowd, some in
  ponchos, some shirtless, singing in the pouring rain - and this is the big
  part - WITH Michael. Can you see it? There aren't many artists who would
  sacrifice being dry to jam with a crowd dedicated to upbeat, fun,
  reggae-techno music.

Just recently I was able to experience one of my most favorite concerts [{Michael Franti & Spearhead}][0] at Summerfest. Picture a small crowd, some in ponchos, some shirtless, singing in the pouring rain - and this is the big part - WITH Michael. Can you see it? There aren't many artists who would sacrifice being dry to jam with a crowd dedicated to upbeat, fun, reggae-techno music.

If you have a few minutes, take the time to listen to his new album {[SOULROCKER][1]} and I think you'll be equally as pumped up as we were!
